      Please fill out the information in this issue template so that we can efficiently process your request for a library update on cdnjs.

      To update a library on cdnjs, it must have a way for an auto-update mechanism to be used.
      This can either be via a Git repository that has versions tagged, with the required files included in the repository at the tag.
      Or, this can be done via an NPM package.
