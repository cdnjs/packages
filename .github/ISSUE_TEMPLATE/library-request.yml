      Please fill out the information in this issue template so that we can efficiently process your request for a new library to be added to cdnjs.

      To add a library to cdnjs, it must have a way for an auto-update mechanism to be used.
      This can either be via a Git repository that has versions tagged, with the required files included in the repository at the tag.
      Alternatively, this can be done via an NPM package.

      cdnjs has a basic popularity requirement for libraries being added.
      Please ensure the library you are requesting has at least 800 downloads per month on NPM or over 200 stars on GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket.
